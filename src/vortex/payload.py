    Represents a configured application payload.

    Payloads are made up of groups of files obtained using a
    :class:`vortex.acquirer.Acquirer`, then deployed to the local system
    according to rules defined within the payload itself.

    Payloads are configured in the :class:`vortex.config.VortexConfiguration`
    file as sections named ``payload:_name_``.

    The following configuration options are *required* for each defined
    payload:

        ``acquire_method``
           The method used to acquire the payload. This value is passed
           verbatim into the :meth:`vortex.acquirer.Acquirer.factory` method's
           ``method`` parameter.

    The following configuration options are *optional*:

        ``environment`` = ``development``
           Parameter passed to the payload deployment process. This can be used
           to configure the payload for a particular environment, for example
           using different settings for a development mode compared to a
           production environment.
