"""
Provides cross-platform tools to validate and influence the environment that
Vortex is running in.

When this module is imported, various pre-requisite checks are run, such as
checking that we are running on a new enough version of Python and that the
underlying kernel is Linux.

Further to this, various tools are provided to check for and install Python
modules using distribution tooling (e.g. Apt or Yum).

.. note:: Because this module is used to check for and install missing
   dependencies, it cannot itself use any such dependent Python modules itself.
