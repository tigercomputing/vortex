Compatibility functions and wrappers.

.. py:function:: import_module(name[, package=None])

   On Python >= 2.7, this is simply a re-exported version of
   :func:`importlib.import_module`.

   On Python 2.6, where :mod:`importlib` does not exist, this provides a very
   simple wrapper around :func:`__import__` that doesn't support relative
   import. The ``package`` argument is ignored, and a
   :exc:`NotImplementedError` is raised if the ``name`` argument starts with a
   dot (``.``).

.. py:function:: shell_quote(s)

   On Python >= 3.3, this is a re-exported and renamed version of
   :func:`shlex.quote`. Otherwise, this is a re-exported and renamed version of
   :func:`pipes.quote`.
