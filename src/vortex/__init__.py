Vortex provides a means to specialise a bare Linux cloud instance according to
a version-controlled configuration.

It is designed to be bootstrapped from an `Amazon AWS`_ instance's `User Data`_
field using `Cloud-Init`_. From there it configures your instance according to
your configuration (for example using `Puppet`_).

.. _Amazon AWS: http://aws.amazon.com/
.. _User Data:

.. _Cloud-Init: https://launchpad.net/cloud-init
.. _Puppet: https://puppetlabs.com/
