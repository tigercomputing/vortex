Vortex
======

Vortex provides a means to specialise a bare Linux cloud instance according to
a version-controlled configuration.

It is designed to be bootstrapped from an [Amazon AWS][aws] instance's
[User Data][user-data] field using [Cloud-Init][cloud-init]. From there it
configures your instance according to your configuration (for example using
[Puppet][puppet]).

[aws]: http://aws.amazon.com/
[user-data]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html
[cloud-init]: https://launchpad.net/cloud-init
[puppet]: https://puppetlabs.com/
